# PostWeaningDiarrhea
That project aim to investigate the impact of various treatments, including ZnO, nutraceuticals, and vaccination, on the average daily weight gain of piglets during different post-weaning periods. The findings of this study will contribute to our understanding of effective control strategies for post-weaning diarrhea,
considering the emerging concerns regarding antimicrobial resistance and the potential legislative restrictions on the use of zinc oxide.


Post-weaning diarrhea (PWD) is a prevalent and economically significant disease affecting pigs in piggeries worldwide. This condition leads to various detrimental effects, including increased mortality rates, weight loss, retarded growth, elevated treatment costs, and augmented usage of antibiotics. The primary cause of PWD is believed to be Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC), a type of bacteria commonly found in the intestinal tracts of affected pigs.
Traditionally, antimicrobial agents have been employed to control the disease; however, the emergence of antimicrobial resistance in E. coli has raised concerns and necessitated the exploration of alternative strategies. For instance, researchers have investigated the inclusion of additional dietary fiber, reduction of crude protein levels, and the use of zinc oxide (ZnO) as potential solutions. Notably, the inclusion of ZnO has shown promising effects in mitigating PWD. However, it is worth mentioning that the use of zinc oxide may be restricted by European Union legislation starting from 2022.
Another potential strategy to combat PWD is vaccination of the piglets. In the present study, we aim to investigate the efficacy of vaccination compared to the addition of ZnO and nutraceuticals (such as dietary fibers) to the piglets' feed. The study examines five distinct treatment groups, each consisting of 128 piglets distributed among 40 pens, with 16 piglets per pen. The treatments include variations in feed composition and vaccination protocols.
To evaluate the effectiveness of the different treatments, we focus on three specific outcome measures: average daily weight gain (ADWG) during different post-weaning periods. ADWG0021 represents the average daily weight gain between 0 and 21 days post-weaning, ADWG2150 represents the average daily weight gain between day 21 and day 50 post-weaning, and ADWG0050 represents the average daily weight gain between 0 and 50 days post-weaning.
